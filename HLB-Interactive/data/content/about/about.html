<![CDATA[<strong>Hong Leong Bank Berhad</strong> ("Hong Leong Bank" or "Bank"), a public listed company on Bursa Malaysia, is a member of the Hong Leong Group Malaysia ("the Group"). Headquartered in Malaysia, the Group has been in the financial services industry since 1968 through Hong Leong Finance Berhad and since 1982 through Dao Heng Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong. Dao Heng Bank Ltd. has since been sold to another banking institution.

In 1989, it was renamed MUI Bank, operating in 35 branches. In January 1994, the Group acquired MUI Bank through Hong Leong Credit Berhad (now known as Hong Leong Financial Group Berhad). This milestone saw the birth of Hong Leong Bank and in October the same year, Hong Leong Bank was listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (now known as Bursa Malaysia). </p>
